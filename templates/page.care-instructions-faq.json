All of our hair after washing will dry with a natural, loose wave if not styled. With some quick and basic styling, the hair will easily return to its silky, smooth state. As all of our extensions are made from 100% human hair, they can be straightened, curled, blow-dried or styled in any way you like! Here's our top tips for safe styling…<br/><br/><strong>ALWAYS</strong> use a heat protection spray on the hair before using any heated tools such as tongs, straighteners, wavers, hair dryers or heated rollers. This will protect the hair from the heat and prevent any damage.<br/><br/><strong>USE</strong> heatless alternatives when possible to reduce the amount of heat on the hair. Braids and soft rollers are perfect for creating heatless curls!<br/><br/><strong>AFTER</strong> washing your permanent hair extensions it's best to completely dry the roots to prevent any build up or irritation.<br/><br/><strong>180-190</strong> is the max temperature you should be using on hair extensions to avoid any damage or breakage.</p>",

We advise only ever having a qualified extensionist apply your hair for the safest and best results.<br/><br/><strong>ALWAYS</strong> attend your maintenance appointments. All types of hair extensions will need repositioning or replacing after 6-8 weeks of wear, skipping these appointments can cause damage to your own hair and the hair extensions.<br/><br/>Loosely braid your hair whilst you sleep to prevent any knotting or matting forming.<br/><br/>Sleeping on a silk pillowcase is better for your hair and hair extensions as it is softer than cotton. When you move in your sleep your hair rubs against the surface of your pillow, having a soft material like silk reduces the friction.</p>",
